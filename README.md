## Project 1: Book Recommendation System
Developed a book recommendation system that suggests top-rated books to users based on their similarity to other users. Using Python, I prepared the data by selecting books rated by at least 100 readers and users who rated at least 50 books, creating a meaningful interaction dataset. A pivot table was created with users as rows and books as columns, with missing values filled with zeros to prepare for similarity calculations. A user-user similarity matrix was built using cosine similarity to identify similar users. The recommendation functionality was implemented to suggest books based on the preferences of the most similar users. The model was then deployed using Streamlit, providing a user-friendly interface for selecting users and viewing book recommendations, enhanced with visual elements like background images. This system effectively identifies similar users and recommends highly rated books, offering personalized book suggestions to enhance the userâ€™s reading experience.
